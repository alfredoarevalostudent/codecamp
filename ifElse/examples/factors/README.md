Students create a program to help complete a series of problems about
the factors of numbers.

### Problems

1. Is 12 a factor of 256?
2. Is 6 a factor of 372?
3. Is 122 a factor of 688?
4. Is 17 a factor of 61?
5. Is 23 a factor of 2185?
6. Is 8 a factor of 10254?
7. Is 99 a factor of 4950?
8. Is 54 a factor of 55895?
9. Is 213 a factor of 2129148?
10. Is 61 a factor of 1526?

## Create

Create two variables: `base` and `factor`. Prompt the user for values to store.

Define a function named `checkForFactor` that accepts two parameters and returns
a string.

## Call

Example function call:
```js
console.log(checkForFactor(num1,num2))
```

## Output

Example true output:
```
YES, 5 is a factor of 90
```
Example false output:
```
NO, 55 is NOT a factor of 100
```
