# Age Calculator

Create a program that finds the age by subtracting the birthYear variable from the currentYear variable

## Define variables

Create three variables: `birthYear`, `currentYear`, `age`. Then set the values of `birthYear` and `currentYear`.

## Subtract

Define the variable `age` to equal the difference of `birthYear` and `currentYear`

## Display information

Use `console.log(age)`  to display the information.

The output should look like this:
```
27
```

## Bonus

Add strings to the `console.log` make the output into a full sentence:
```
You are 27 years old
```
