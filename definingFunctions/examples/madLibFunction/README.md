# Mad Lib Function

Define a function that creates a Mad Lib story using variable defined in the function.
This means that no variables should be outside of the function definition.

## Define

Define a function named `madLibStory`

Create these four variables and give them all values:

	`noun`
	`verb`
	`adjective1`
	`adjective2`

Create a variable called `story`. `story` should be set to equal a string with the variables added into them.
It can be multiple sentences and needs to use all of the variables. 

A short example with only 2 variables could be:
```
var story = "Writing a story about " + noun + " and his " + adjective1 + " family."
```

## Output

The function should use a `console.log` to output the story to the console.

Example function call:
```
madLibStory()
```

Example output: 
```
Writing a story about a frog and his smelly family.
```
