# Age Calculator Function

Create a function that outputs the age of a user. This is a continuation of the ageCalculator activity from the variable lesson.

## Define

Define and set values of two variables: `currentYear` and `birthYear`
Then define a function called `ageCalculator`

## Output

The function should use a `console.log` to create a full sentence with the user's age

Example function call:
```js
ageCalculator()
```
Example output:
```
You are 25 years old.
```
