# Distance Calculator

Create a function that measures the distance give the speed and time
To measure distance remember that:

```
distance = speed * time
```

The function should return the distance

## Define

Define a function called `distanceCalculator` that returns `distance` by multiplying the parameters `speed` and `time`.

## Call
`distanceCalculator` should be called three times and the values returned should be added togehter.

Example function call:
```
var sum = distanceCalculator(25, 2) + distanceCalculator(30, 4) + distanceCalculator(10, 6)
```

## Output
Use `console.log` to output `sum` to the console. The output should be in the form of a sentence

Example output:
```
The total distance is 230 miles
```
