# User object

## Create the object

Create an object called userInfo that has information about the user. The user object should have
at least 3 fields:

	- name
	- username
	- age

## Display the information

Create a function called getUser that accepts an object as a parameter. The function should log
the information to the console.

Function call:
```js
getUser(userInfo)
```
Example output:
```

## Bonus
Use an `if/else` to check to make sure there is an object that was passed to the function.
