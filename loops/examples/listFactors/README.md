# Find Factors

Write a program that find all of the factors of a given number.

## Information

Factors are numbers you can multiply together to get another number.
- For example
2 is a factor of 6 because :
```
2 * 3 = 6
```


- You can find a factor by dividing numbers. If the remainder is 0 then the number is a factor
- In Javascript you can use `%` to check for a remainder
- For example 2 is not a factor of 7 because
```
7 % 2 = 1
```

## Create

#### Variables
- Make a variable named `baseNumber` that stores a number after prompting the user

#### Loop
- Use a for loop to check every number smaller than `baseNumber` to check if it is a factor

## Output
Each time a factor is found, use a `console.log` to output it to the console

Example output:
```
What number ?100
1 is a factor
2 is a factor
4 is a factor
5 is a factor
10 is a factor
20 is a factor
25 is a factor
50 is a factor
100 is a factor
```
