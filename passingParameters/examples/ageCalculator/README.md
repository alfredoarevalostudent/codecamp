# Age Calculator with Parameters

In this activity, create an age calculator function that uses parameters to determing the values
of `birthYear` and `currentYear`

## Define

Define a function called `ageCalculator` that accepts two parameters: `birthYear` and `currentYear`
The function should determine the users age using those numbers.

## Call

In the program, the `ageCalculator` function should be called at least three times with different values each time.

Example function call:
```js
ageCalculator(1987, 2015)
ageCalculator(2000, 2015)
ageCalculator(1950, 2015)
```

## Output

The `ageCalculator` function should output the user's age as a sentence to the console.

Example output:
```
You are 28 years old
You are 15 years old
You are 65 years old
```
