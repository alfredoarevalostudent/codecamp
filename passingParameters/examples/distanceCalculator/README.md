# Time Calculator

Create a program to help solve the following time related problems.

### Problem #1

Jenny, Carlos, and Juan are riding their bikes to 7-11. They all live a different
distance from the store and ride their bikes at different speeds. Assuming they all left their houses at the same time, who got to 7-11 first?

Use the information from the table below.

Name | Distance | Speed
---|----|----
Jenny | 12.1 miles | 10.2 mph
Carlos | 8.3 miles | 7.6 mph
Juan | 9.6 miles | 9.1 mph
## Information

To measure distance:

```js
time = distance / speed
```

## Define

Prompt the user to enter speed and time values for three different trips in a car.

Store the information in variables:

  - `name1`
  - `speed1`
  - `time1`
  - `name2`
  - `speed2`
  - `time2`
  - `name3`
  - `speed3`
  - `time3`

Define a function called `distanceCalculator` that returns `distance` by multiplying the parameters `speed` and `time`.

Define a function called `makeSentece` that returns a string with the information about how long a person's trip took.
